# Clustering, Business Strategy and Recomendation Case - Challenge 7 - DNC

## Case Description
### Context
You were hired by an e-commerce company that is seeking to better understand its customers' behavior in order to personalize its marketing campaigns. To do this, the company has provided a CSV database containing data on customers, products, and store transactions made between the years 2010 and 2011.

Based on this data, you need to group customers into clusters according to their purchasing behavior. This will allow you to identify patterns and common characteristics among customers, such as:
- Customers who buy the same products;
- Customers who have the same purchase frequency;
- Customers who spend more money on their purchases.

From these clusters, generate insights so the company can better segment its customer base and personalize its marketing campaigns, targeting promotions and offers to customers based on their purchasing behavior.

Develop a clustering model capable of grouping customers according to their purchasing behavior, taking into account the RFM calculated in Challenge 4. Analyze the resulting clusters to identify customer profiles, such as patterns and common characteristics, to determine their purchasing behavior. Use graphs and visualizations to assist in the analysis.

Don't forget to document each step, justifying the choices made. It is essential to report the insights obtained and recommend future actions that the company can implement. Good luck!
